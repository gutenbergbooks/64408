<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>IT is a fact universally allowed, that few authors are so totally
indifferent to the stamp which their writings may bear in the minds of
the public, as to feel no anxiety concerning their success; and to
contemplate with perfect composure, the prospect of a critical analysis
of their productions, in which, each blemish is to be exposed to the
most rigid censure.</p>

<p>No writer is entirely exempt from this doubtful solicitude&mdash;even those
who have raised themselves above the quibblings of fire-side
commentators, and are only read to be admired, have their moments of
fear;&mdash;the opinions of the public may change; critics may condemn, and
their names may be tarnished by a failure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> then, those who possess every classical requisite for poetical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_iv" id="page_iv">{iv}</a></span>excellence; who are blessed with time, retirement, and an access to the
writings of all nations, and ages; whose minds are cheered in their
pursuits, by a solid hope of success, founded on the remembrance of
former approbation, cannot altogether confide in their infallibility. It
will not be doubted, that a youth, unlettered, and unlearned, who in his
first essay has been debarred all those advantages which are considered
almost indispensible in the pursuit of literary distinction&mdash;should
appear before the public with the utmost diffidence; fearful that the
pursuit which has given him employment in his midnight hours, and added
a zest to his short period of leisure, should reflect discredit upon his
authorship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> writer of <span class="smcap">Hours of Childhood</span>, far from enjoying “<i>Poetic leisure</i>,”
has, from the age of thirteen, filled a situation which requires “the
vigorous hand of stedfast application,” and, which has left little time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_v" id="page_v">{v}</a></span>for studious improvement: But his work is to appear on the same stage,
with the productions of the man of science; and to be judged by the same
tribunal.&mdash;These are not happy auspices&mdash;yet, he ventures to present
this volume to the public, conscious of the many defects which may be
discovered in it,&mdash;but hoping to reap instruction from its fate. Nor
would he deprecate criticism; he wishes only that the sentence bestowed
upon it, should, as far as justice will allow, consider the
circumstances under which it appears. It has no patron; it goes forth
into the world, unprotected, and alone&mdash;to stand or fall by its own
merits&mdash;as a tender parent ushers into the world a beloved
child;&mdash;sensible of his faults, he cherishes a hope, that it will judge
of them with charity; nor crush, by a sentence too severe, the latent
seeds of virtue which may spring up to maturity and perfection. The
child has been his comfort, in many an hour of sorrow; and fancy, with
healing influ<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span>ence, has drawn his growing virtues starting forth into
fragrant blossom. For whatever national feeling is expressed in this
work, an apology cannot be necessary to a reasonable person, of what
country soever: The warm attachment of the author to his <i>Native Land</i>,
is but the natural feeling of every honest heart,&mdash;in that land, the
hours of infancy were whiled away under the influence of hope, and
fancy; and the delights of that innocent period, are engraven on the
tablets of memory, in the lovely hues of youthful imagination. Nor does
this laudable partiality cast a reflection upon the same predilection in
the natives of other countries; those who feel the true <i>amor patriæ</i>
are charmed with the same sentiment in others of whatever nation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> smaller pieces are the effusions of the moment written at different
times, and are incapable of being altered from their original
crudeness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span></p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
